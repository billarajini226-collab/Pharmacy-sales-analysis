 so,here the margin shall be improved .
 
-When comes to tablets few tablets where sold 
 at high while comes to low sales of tablets 
 shall be increased by providing services to the customers 
 instead of providing services to high sales of product.

 -over all tablets generat higher profit ,
 but the loop hole is where the high sales of 
 products are not providing high profit where compared to 
 low value of tablets 

 -when it comes to companies ,A company like 
  VASU PHARMA are contributing high sales,
  whie the others are not so, here we need to increase 
  the saes for the companies but, yes even we need to maintain 
  intermediary customers but ensuring the services shall be limited.

  purchasing power using there strategy and the sales are 
  boosted up only at the month end.
